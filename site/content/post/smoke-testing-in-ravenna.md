The tests will assist us in locating breaks and defects in the sewer system.  During the test you might see smoke coming form the vent stacks on buildings and from holes in the ground.  Don't be alarmed.  The smoke has no odor and is non-toxic, non-staining, does not create a fire hazard, and will dissipate in a few minutes.  

If smoke comes in your house, it probably means that there are defects in the plumbing that could allow sewer gas to enter.  

if you have any questions regarding the smoke testing, call Irvine Municipal Utilities at 606-723-2197
