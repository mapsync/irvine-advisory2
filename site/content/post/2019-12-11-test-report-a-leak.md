Help us prevent water loss.  If you see clear water running where it normally doesn't, even during rain events, it may be a leak.  If you see water standing or a patch of green grass during droughts, or if you have a continuous "soggy spot" in your yard,  it may be a leak!  If you see a potential problem, just give our office a call and we will dispatch a service person to investigate.  There is only so much drinkable water on the planet, lets not waste it!
