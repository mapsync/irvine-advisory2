Even though Irvine Municipal Utilities water system is in good shape now, we need to beware there are areas in the county that are out of water due to the current flood.  Once these affected areas are brought back online and clean up begins there will be a high demand for water.  For this reason we are asking people to please be mindful of wasting water.
