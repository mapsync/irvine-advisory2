Over the next few months, our service crews will be replacing our meters with new technology.  The new meters along with a new "mesh network"  technology will allow us to read meters remotely, more often, in any type of weather, and inform you of a potential leak sooner!  

During the meter-change-out process you may experience a brief outage.  Some customers may notice a slight change of color in their water after installation.  If so, simply turn on the COLD  water at a sink and it should clear up. 

If you have any questions, feel free to call our office.  Check out some cool videos by clicking on this link  ***http://www.zennerusa.com/index.php?id_cms=11&controller=cms***
