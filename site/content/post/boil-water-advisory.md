Over the next few months, our service crews will be replacing our meters with newer technology.  The new meters along with a new a "mesh network"  reading technology will allow us to read meters remotely, inform customers of leaks sooner, and read more often and in any types of weather.  

During the meter-change-out process you may experience a brief outage.  Some customers may notice a slight change of color in their water after installation.  If so, simply run your sink water on COLD and it should clear up.
