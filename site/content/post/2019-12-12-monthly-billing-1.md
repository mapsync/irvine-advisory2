**In order to avoid service disruptions,  balances must be paid IN FULL before the cut off date. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

IMU water/sewer charges are due on the first day of each month.  If not paid by 11:59 P.M. on the 14th, a 10% penalty (of current charges) will be added to the bill. Cut-off notices will be mailed on the 15th. 
Cut-off date for delinquent IMU water/sewer balances will be conducted after the 20th of the month.
If the water/sewer service has been disconnected for nonpayment a $50 fee will be added. For the service to be reconnected all fees and charges must be paid.  If you have been disconnected and have made a payment online, please contact IMU for service reconnection. 
Terminated services will be reconnected within 24 hours after payment has been received.
