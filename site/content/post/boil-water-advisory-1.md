The boil water advisory has been LIFTED for the residents of Daniels Addition and Pearl Street in Ravenna.  Residents who live on those streets no longer need to boil there water.  We apologize for the delay.  The lab was closed over the weekend and we could not get samples to them until Monday morning.
